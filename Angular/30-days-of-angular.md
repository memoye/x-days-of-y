# 30 Days of Angular

## Day 1 - 07-06-2025

Today, I learned about components.
I first took a little detour to learn about typescript decorators to get an understanding of the syntax `@Component` which was unfamiliar.
I then went ahead to learn more about the anatomy of components, styling them, what selectors are, as well as some best practices for choosing selectors.
I tried looking a bit deeper into binding dynamic values in templates but I got a little confused. I'll look at that some other time after grasping some more of the basics.

### Concepts Covered

- Decorators (TS)
- Composition with components
  - Templates
  - Selectors
  - Binding\*

Tomorrow, carrying on with the essentials, I intend to look at **Reactivity with signals**
